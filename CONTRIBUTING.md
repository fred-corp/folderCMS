# How to contribute ?

Thanks for your interest in this project !  
Contributions are welcome; You can contribute by forking this the repo, making your changes and opening a pull request.  
Maybe add a line or two in README.md on what your contribution is about, so it's easy to syy why the repo has been forked.

Just make shure a feature will be **useful**, and **relevent** to the **project's scope**, and that someone else is not already working on something similar :)
