## Wiki

Everything you need start working with FolderCMS should be explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/fred-corp/folderCMS/wiki).

## Development plans

* [x] Make a prototype
* [x] Polish the prototype to create a working demo
* [x] Create a Docker container
* [ ] Release v1.0
* [ ] Work on feature requests :)

## But why ?

Well, I didn't really find a suitable solution for my website needs. [Automad](https://automad.org) was great, but lacked some flexibility I wanted to have like :

* **Drop-down menus in navbar**  
* Easily make custom themes  
* Upload markdown files in sub-folders in a site-map like fashion
* ... (more to come during doc phase)

This project aims to make those tasks a bit easier.

## How to install

See [How to install](https://github.com/fred-corp/folderCMS/wiki/How-to-install) on wiki.

See [How to use](https://github.com/fred-corp/folderCMS/wiki/How-to-use) on wiki.

## Todo

* Create more themes
* Test the ```files``` folder
* Create live demo website  
* Write better documentation
