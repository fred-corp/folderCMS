## Why would I make a custom Content Management System ?

Well, I didn't really find a suitable solution for what I wanted to do. [Automad](https://automad.org) was great, but lacked some flexibility I wanted to have like :

* Easily make custom themes  
* **Drop-down menus in navbar**
* Upload markdown files in sub-folders in a site-map like fashion
